# Practice

## Chapter 3

### Practice 3.1

> Write a script to calculate the circumference of a circle (C = 2 πr). Comment the script.

```MATLAB

% Calculate the circumference of a circle (C = 2 πr)

radium = 10;
C = 2 * pi * radium
```

### Practice 3.2

> Create a script that would prompt the user for a length, and then ‘f’ for feet or ‘m’ for meters, and store both inputs in variables. For example, when executed, it would look like this (assuming the user enters 12.3 and then m):
>
> Enter the length: 12.3
>
> Is that f(eet)or m(eters)?: m

```MATLAB
length = input('Enter the length:')

feet_or_meters = input('Is that f(eet) or m(eters)?:', 's')

```
