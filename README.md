# Who am I

I am an automotive field SW engineer. My daily work mainly focuses on how to create the model base design with the IBM Rhapsody and MATLAB technolody. So I want to share all my knowledge with you.

And the Dart/Python/Java/JavaScript are also my favorite. I hope all my information can help or assist you for your daily work and study.
